            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How do I play 4Numbers?</h3>
                <p>Each player creates a secret 4-digit code using digits 0-9 (no repeating digits). Take turns guessing your opponent's code. After each guess, you'll see feedback:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong style="color: #4CAF50;">Green dot</strong> = digit is correct and in the right position</li>
                    <li><strong style="color: #FF9800;">Amber dot</strong> = digit is correct but in wrong position</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Use logic and deduction to crack the code. First to guess correctly wins!</p>

                <h3>What game modes are available?</h3>
                <p>4Numbers offers three ways to play:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>vs AI</strong> - Practice against computer opponents at Easy, Medium, or Hard difficulty</li>
                    <li><strong>Local multiplayer</strong> - Play with a friend on the same device, taking turns</li>
                    <li><strong>Online multiplayer</strong> - Challenge players worldwide via Game Center</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How does online multiplayer work?</h3>
                <p>Online games use Apple Game Center. You can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Find random opponent</strong> - Get matched with players worldwide</li>
                    <li><strong>Create private game</strong> - Generate a 6-character code to share with a friend</li>
                    <li><strong>Join with code</strong> - Enter a friend's game code to join their game</li>
                    <li><strong>Invite friend</strong> - Send invites via messages or to Game Center friends</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What are game codes?</h3>
                <p>Game codes are 6-character codes (like "ABC123") used to create private matches with friends. Create a private game to get your code, then share it with your friend. They can enter the code to join your game.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why can't I find an online opponent?</h3>
                <p>If no opponents are found after searching, it means no other players are currently looking for a match. Try again later, invite a friend directly, or practice against the AI.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How do I sign in to Game Center?</h3>
